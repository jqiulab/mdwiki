We explore the gene expression profiles of parvoviruses and study the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA replication and pathogenesis of parvoviruses. We also apply parvovirus as a model system to understand the basic cellular processes of pre-mRNA processing and DNA damage signaling in the [Department of Microbiology](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/microbiology-molecular-genetics-and-immunology.html) at [KUMC](kumc.edu).
